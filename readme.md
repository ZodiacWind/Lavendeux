### Lavendeux enhances the clipboard
Lavendeux inlines calculating, programming and testing utilities into your favourite text editor. Test the result of a remote API call, check the result of a regular expression and much more, all without needing to break your workflow.

#### How to use it
Highlight a block of text in any text editor or text field, and press CTRL-Space. Lavendeux will replace the text with the result of parsing it.

Or, alternatively, turn auto copy/paste off in the menu, and CTRL-Space will instead solve any expressions in your clipboard.

#### Extensions
Extend Lavendeux's featureset with [extensions](http://rscarson.github.io/Lavendeux/extensions). Extensions are written in python, and should be placed in the extensions directory where Lavendeux was installed.
